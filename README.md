Earthquake prProblem Statement:

Explore the key features of earthquake data and design an object for those features, such as date, time, latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude. Before developing the prediction model, visualize the data on a world map to display a complete overview of where the earthquake frequency will be higher. Split the data into a training set and a test set for validation. Lastly, build a neural network to fit the data from the training set.

Problem Definition: 

The problem is to develop an earthquake prediction model using a Kaggle dataset. The objective is to explore and understand the key features of earthquake data, visualize the data on a world map for a global overview, split the data for training and testing, and build a neural network model to predict earthquake magnitudes based on the given features.

Steps:  

1.Data Analysis: We have to analyse the loaded dataset.The descriptive statistical measures gives some idea regarding the distribution of data.
2.Feature Engineering: It helps to derive some valuable features from the existing ones.
3.Exploratory data analysis: EDA is one of the most important steps in the data science project life cycle and here one will need to know that how to make inferences from the visualizations and data analysis.
4.The outliers are confirmed by using boxplot.
5.We are using plotly to plot the data.

Design Thinking:

Data Source: Choose a suitable Kaggle dataset containing earthquake data with features like date, time, latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude.
Feature Exploration: Analyze and understand the distribution, correlations, and characteristics of the key features.
Visualization: Create a world map visualization to display earthquake frequency distribution.
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into a training set and a test set for model validation.
Model Development: Build a neural network model for earthquake magnitude prediction.
Training and Evaluation: Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.ediction model using python
